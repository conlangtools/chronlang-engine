# Contributing to Chronlang Engine

## Preface
Thanks for your interest in the project and in contributing to the Chronlang Engine codebase.

At present, the requirements of the project are fluid, which is not conducive to open collaboration;
However, I _am_ open to suggestions if you have specific ideas of how you'd like to contribute.

## Before Contributing
If you wish to contribute to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make in
the [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/yc5E5qbk6S), or by creating a GitHub issue and
waiting for a response from a maintainer.

This is only a small hobby project for me ([@faewd](https://github.com/faewd)), so please exercise
patience when waiting for responses to issues, PRs, or Discord messages.
